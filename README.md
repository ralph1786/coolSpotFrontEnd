# CoolSpots

Application where users can add places they have visited around the world. They can add reviews to these places.

## Getting Started

To get the application up and running you must clone this project, which is the frontend of the application as well as the backend that has the name of coolSpotsBackend. Once you have cloned both repositories go into your backend, and in the terminal run **rails s** to start the rails server. 

For the frontend first run **npm install** to install all the dependencies for this project. When the dependencies have been installed make sure install all the devDependencies as well, since **npm install** will not do this. Once all the dependencies are installed you can run the following command on the terminal:

```
npm run dev:server
```
This will start Webpack development server, which will refresh your application when you save any file.
